    geometry pieces will now be aligned correctly with the armature, this is
    most noticable with Morrowind imports

=============================

* pycheck: added pychecker script (see http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/)

* test: added test script to automatically run importer and exporter on a range

  geometries had their transform applied twice, so this fixes import of those
  skinned models that do not have a unit transform.

* Export: fixed a typo

* Import/Export/Config/GUI: restructured the scripts, in particular the
  import script has been transformed into an OOP class, so it requires
  no more globals for various settings. All gui and config related
  things have moved to a new nif_common.py library, as well as some
  common settings such as checking for Blender and PyFFI version. The
  result is that the code has been substantially simplified. The import
  and export script now also use exactly the same system to run the
  config gui.

=============================

* Import: provide sensible error message on kf import

* Export: set flags to 0x000E for Oblivion ninodes and nitrishapes/nitristrips

* Export: automatically set blender collision type, draw type, and draw mode on
  old style (RootCollisionNode named mesh) morrowind collision export

Version 2.1.11 (Oct 3, 2007)
============================

* Export: complain on unweighted vertices and select them, instead of adding an
  extra bone (this is a better alternative to the Scene Root.00 "feature" which
  was pretty frustrating at times when you had to hunt down unweighted vertices)

* Export: switched to using Mesh instead of using the deprecated NMesh

* Export: fixed frame time bug

* Import: removing dummy index does not properly delete the vertex from
  the mesh (yielding errors in the vertex key data), so reverted back to shift
  checking algorithm to fix face index order; the vertex order is shifted in
  place yielding simpler code and faster performance

* Import: removed _bindMatrix zombies, other minor cleanups

* Config: check blender version and raise exception if blender is outdated

Version 2.1.10 (Sep 27, 2007)

* Export: fairly large restructuring of the code, the Python modules are only
  loaded once

* Export: fixed alpha controller export

* Export: removed disfunctional material color controller export

* Export: added a timer

* Export: new option to merge seams between objects, if you separated meshes
  in different parts then on export often seams could appear between the parts
  (the better bodies meshes are good examples of this problem), now there is an
  option to recalculate the normals on seams between objects on export (for
  better bodies the result is a seamless body on re-export)

Version 2.1.9 (Sep 21, 2007)
============================

* Export: new option to force dds extension of texture paths

* updated hull script for quickly creating bounding spheres

Version 2.1.8 (Sep 17, 2007)
============================

  Freedom Force vs. The 3rd Reich

* Export: automatic settings for Freedom Force vs. The 3rd Reich

* Export: compacter gui

* new script for quickly creating bounding boxes 

Version 2.1.7 (Sep 9, 2007)

  bounds shape

* Export: make 'Bip01' root node also root of nif tree

Version 2.1.5 (Sep 2, 2007)
===========================

* Export: mopps for packed shapes

* Export: always strip texture paths (except for Morrowind and Oblivion)

* Import: shared texture folder detection for CivIV

* Import: assume stub has alpha channel if texture was not found and alpha
  property is present; this will ensure that NiAlphaProperty is written back on
  export

============================

* Export: fixed more bugs in bhkConvexVerticesShape

* Export: NiVertexColorProperty and NiZBufferProperty blocks for CivIV

Version 2.1.3 (Aug 19, 2007)
============================

* Installer: also check in HKCU for registry keys of Python and PyFFI (fixes
  rare installation issue, see bug #1775859 on the SF tracker)

* new script for reducing number of influences per vertex, running this script
  before export helps if the skin partitioning algorithm complains about losing
  weights

Version 2.1.2 (Aug 17, 2007)
============================

* Installer: make sure user is admin ("fixes" the Vista bug)

* Import: parent selected objects to armature when importing skeleton only

* Import/Export: Python profiler support (read Defaults.py for details)

Version 2.1.1 (Aug 14, 2007)
============================

* Export: quite a few bug fixes in Oblivion collision export, saner settings

* Export: option to toggle the use of bhkListShape

* Import: fix for skeleton.nif files

* Import: reverted to 2.0.5 bone import system if bone alignment is turned
  off, looks much better for Oblivion imports

Version 2.1 (Aug 12, 2007)
==========================

* Export: added support for Oblivion collisions

  - bhkBoxShape (from Blender 'Box' bounding shape)

  - bhkSphereShape (from Blender 'Sphere' bounding shape)

  - bhkCapsuleShape (from Blender 'Cylinder' bounding shape)

  - bhkPackedNiTriStripsShape (from Blender 'Static TriangleMesh' bounding shape)

  - bhkConvexVerticesShape (from Blender 'Convex Hull Polytope' bounding shape);
    Note that many of the settings are not well understood, so you probably still
    have to tweak the collision settings in nifskope. But at least the collision
    geometries should be properly exported.

* Export: fixed issue with skin partition creation on older nif versions (such as Freedom Force vs. 3rd Reich nifs)

* Export: fixed problem with meshes sharing the same vcol lighting enabled material but not all having vertex weights (such as the Oblivion steel cuirass); the exporter now issues a warning rather than throwing an exception

* Export: fixed skin bounds calculation
