Textures
--------

.. _textures:

* Textures/Maps allow us to add additional detail to the geometry, each having a different use.
* In order to add a texture we need the following:

#. :ref:`A Mesh-object <geometry-mesh>`.
#. The Mesh-object needs to be :ref:`uv-unwrapped <geometry-uv>`.
#. That Mesh-object requires :ref:`a Material <properties-material>`.
#. In the **Texture tab**, Click **New** to create **Texture Slot**.

* Creating a texture slot should create a texture in that slot by default.
