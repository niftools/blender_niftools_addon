Textures
--------

.. _textures:

| A texture refers to a generic image.
| A map refer to an image which has specific properties which will influence the renderer.
| Textures/Maps allow us to alter how the geometry is rendered, such as adding additional detail, affecting light, etc.

Notes
~~~~~

* The nif format only supports UV mapped textures, so only those will be exported.
* GLSL mode is enabled on import/export, but should be enabled manually otherwise to give correct viewport preview.
* Relative paths for textures are often used, eg. /Texture/../.. which should be adjusted so Blender can render in the viewport.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding textures requires the following:

#. :ref:`A Mesh-object <geometry-mesh>`.
#. The Mesh-object needs to be :ref:`uv-unwrapped <geometry-uv>`.
#. That Mesh-object requires :ref:`a Material <properties-material>`.


Creating a Texture Slot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a Texture slot to hold a texture.

* In the **Texture tab**, Click **New** to create **Texture Slot**.

A texture slot has a default texture, we set type of image we will use:

* Under **Type**, select **Image or Movie**or **Enviromental**, see :ref:`texture maps<texture_maps>`

We load an image to use as our texture.

* Next to **Image**, click **Open**, and select the desired texture image.

Set the texture to use the UV coordinates.

* Under **Mapping > Coordinates**, select **UV**.

The UV layer that was :ref:`create previously<geometry-uv>` needs to be selected for this texture.

* In the **Texture** tab, under **Mapping > Layer**, click on the empty field, and select ``UVTex``.

Texture Maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Texture Map affects different properties of how the geometry is rendered
