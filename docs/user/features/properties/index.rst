Properties
==========

* Most Nif properties, :class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiProperty` are mapped to some part of Blender's Material System.
* The following section goes through those Blender material settings and how they relate to those properties.
* Unless otherwise stated your mesh needs to have a material to use these properties.

Example

#. :ref:`Create a mesh-object <geometry-mesh>` as explained before.
#. In the **Properties** panel, in the *Material* tab
   click **New** to create a new material.
#. Assign the Material an appropriate name.
