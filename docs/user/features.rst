Features
========

.. todo::

   It would be a good habit to document every feature we have,
   and quick instructions for how to use them.

Geometry
--------

.. _features-example-geometry:

Example
~~~~~~~

#. Start blender with an empty scene.
#. Add a cube primitive: **Add > Mesh > Cube**.
#. Select whether the mesh should be Double-sided:
   in the *Properties* panel, in the *Object Data* tab,
   untick **Double Sided**.
#. Export the file: **File > Export > NetImmerse/Gamebryo**.

Notes
~~~~~

Each :class:`~bpy.types.Mesh` is exported to
one or more :class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiTriShape`\ s.

The nif format only supports triangle based geometry,
so beware that blender quads are exported as triangles,
which may lead to small differences in how the geometry is rendered.

Strips (:class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiTriStrips`\ s)
are not supported due to the fact that they are
`unnecessary for current hardware
<http://tomsdxfaq.blogspot.com/2005_12_01_archive.html>`_.

Materials
---------

.. _features-example-material:

Example
~~~~~~~

#. :ref:`Create a single sided cube <features-example-geometry>`
   as explained before.
#. In the *Properties* panel, in the *Material* tab,
   click **New** to create a new material.
#. Under **Diffuse**, click on the color, and set it to completely white
   (**R**, **G**, and **B** should each say 1.000,
   whereas the default is 0.800).
#. Under **Specular**, set **Intensity** to 0.000, to disable specularity
   (this will prevent a NiSpecularProperty being exported,
   which is usually what you want).
#. Now you will want to :ref:`add a texture <features-example-texture>`.

Notes
~~~~~

Every :class:`~bpy.types.Material` is exported to a
:class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiMaterialProperty`.

The nif format only supports a single material per
:class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiTriShape`,
hence for this purpose, a multimaterial mesh will
be exported as multiple
:class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiTriShape`\ s,
one for each material.

.. todo::

   Document these guys:
   :class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiAlphaProperty`,
   :class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiSpecularProperty`,
   :class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiWireframeProperty`,
   :class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiStencilProperty`,
   any others?

Textures
--------

.. _features-example-texture:

Example
~~~~~~~

#. :ref:`Create a single sided cube <features-example-geometry>`.
#. :ref:`Add a material <features-example-material>`.
#. In the *Properties* panel, in the *Texture* tab,
   click **New** to create a new material texture slot.
#. Under **Type**, select **Image or Movie**.
#. Next to **Image**, click **Open**,
   and select the desired texture image.
#. Under **Mapping > Coordinates**, select **UV**.
#. Under **Influence > Diffuse**,
   make sure **Color** is selected,
   and nothing else.
#. Go back to the 3D view, and switch to edit mode
   (press ``TAB``).
#. Press ``U``, select **Unwrap > Smart UV Project**.
#. Switch back to object mode
   (press ``TAB`` again).
#. Again in the *Texture* tab,
   under **Mapping > Layer**,
   click on the empty field,
   and select ``UVTex``.
#. Now export as usual.

Notes
~~~~~

The nif format only supports UV mapped textures,
so only those will be exported.

Currently, only the base texture is exported.

.. todo::

   Describe required settings for each texture slot.

Vertex Color
------------

.. _features-example-vertexcolor:

#. :ref:`Create a single sided cube <features-example-geometry>`
   as explained before.
#. Switch to Vertex Paint mode, 
   this automatically adds a base vertex color layer.
#. Apply the desired vertex colors evenly to the vertex.
#. Ensure you have added a material.
#. Now export as usual.

Notes
~~~~~

The nif format only supports a single color per vertex, whereas Blender vertex color per face vertex.
Blender treats the vertex as if the faces had been split apart. 
Even though they share that vertex, each of those face can have a different color for that vertex.
Eg. A vertex in a cube is shared by four faces. 
On export the scripts will take an average of colors. 

.. warning::
   alpha values currently are not written.

.. todo::
   Write up workflow for alpha layer once implemented.

Collision
---------

.. warning::

   Collisions are in the process of being ported. This section is incomplete and will change.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. _features-example-physics:

Physics Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To indicate the physics properties for an object, switch to the **Blender Game** tab. (Default tab is **Blender Render**)

#. With the collision object selected, switch to the **Physics** tab

#. Click **Collision Bounds** and select **Box** as **Bounds**

#. If you would like to define your own settings for havok physics, click **Use Blender Properties** and define the fields **Havok Material**, **Motion System**, **Oblivion Layer**, **Quality Type** and **Col Filter** accordingly.

#. If you want the exporter to define the havok physics properties for you, make sure **Use Blender Properties** is not clicked.

#. Now you can continue editing the mesh until you are ready to export. 

Box Collision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. :ref:`Create a single sided cube <features-example-geometry>`
   as explained before.

#. :ref:`Create another single sided cube <features-example-geometry>`
   as explained before.

#. Select the second newly created cube and rename it, like 'CollisionBox' via the Object panel

#. In the Object panel, under Display, select Type and change it to **Wire**, this will make it easier to find.

#. Scale the collision cube 'CollisionBox' to the size wanted.

#. :ref:`Add physics to our collision cube 'CollisionBox' <features-example-physics>`.

#. Now export as usual

Notes
~~~~~

To indicate that a mesh is to be exported as a collision object,
rather than say a :class:`~pyffi.formats.nif.NifFormat.NiTriShape`,
select the blender **Game Engine** renderer, select the object's physics
tab, enable the **Collision Bounds** option, and select the desired
**Bounds**. For Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Fallout NV, blender's
collision types map to the following nif types:

============= ======================
blender       nif
============= ======================
Box           bhkBoxShape
Sphere        bhkSphereShape
Cylinder      bhkCapsuleShape
Capsule       bhkCapsuleShape
Convex Hull   bhkConvexVerticesShape
Triangle Mesh bhkMoppByTreeShape
============= ======================

For Morrowind, we have:

============= =================
blender       nif
============= =================
Triangle Mesh RootCollisionNode
============= =================

.. todo::

   Where do we store material, layer, quality type, motion system, etc.?

Bounding Box
------------

.. todo::

   Write.
