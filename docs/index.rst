Welcome to Blender NIF Plugin documentation!
============================================

.. warning::

   Documentation is incomplete and is still a work in progress.

The Blender Nif Plugin is a Blender addon that adds support for import and export NIF files.
The Nif Plugin allows the user to create custom content for a variety of games which use the nif format.

Features:
 - Native support for reading & writing of .nif files.
 - Integration with Blender modules: Mesh, Texture, Armature, Animation & Collision Systems
 - Custom UI to expose Nif specific data
 - Utility scripts 

This is one of the many nif-related projects developed by Niftools, our open source community.
