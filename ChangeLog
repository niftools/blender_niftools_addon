Version 2.2.0 (Nov 19, 2007)
* Export: new settings for Oblivion to control rigid body parameters and
material
* Export: calculation of mass, center of gravity, and inertia tensor in rigid 
body, which is useful for non-static clutter
* Config: refactored the config gui to get rid of most geometry parameters when
drawing the gui

* Import: fixed trivial bug in get_blender_object
* Export: improved progress bar
* Export: warn when skin partition settings could be improved on Oblivion export

* Import: inform about name of Blender object and nif block when losing vertex
weights
* Import: update scene even if import fails
* Import: fixed error with parentship if you imported a skeleton without
selecting anything

selected armature (it seems to work pretty well for Oblivion meshes but not so
good on Morrowind meshes)
* Import: improved morrowind skeleton import (for example via base_anim files)

Version 2.1.15 (Oct 19, 2007)
* pycheck: added pychecker script (see http://pychecker.sourceforge.net/)
* test: added test script to automatically run importer and exporter on a range
of selected nif and blend files
* Import/Export: PyFFI 0.5 is now required; the Blender scripts can now read
and write a whole range of new nif versions (see PyFFI ChangeLog for details)
* Import/Export: small GUI improvements
* Import: ignore NiCamera root blocks instead of raising an exception on them
* Import: fixed a bug preventing animation import
* Import: fixed some progress bar issues

* Import: removed duplicate calculation of armature inverse matrix
* Import: replaced the deprecated method of linking armature to the scene
* Export: improved flatten skin so it works better in some cases

Version 2.1.14 (Oct 14, 2007)
* Import: fixed a transform bug which was introduced in 2.1.13, skinned
geometries had their transform applied twice, so this fixes import of those
skinned models that do not have a unit transform.
* Export: fixed a typo
* Import/Export/Config/GUI: restructured the scripts, in particular the
import script has been transformed into an OOP class, so it requires
no more globals for various settings. All gui and config related
things have moved to a new nif_common.py library, as well as some
common settings such as checking for Blender and PyFFI version. The
result is that the code has been substantially simplified. The import
and export script now also use exactly the same system to run the
config gui.

Version 2.1.13 (Oct 13, 2007)

lower case versions of names too
* Import: automatically remove duplicate vertices after joining Morrowind
collision geometries

Version 2.1.12 (Oct 11, 2007)
* Import: provide sensible error message on kf import
* Export: set flags to 0x000E for Oblivion ninodes and nitrishapes/nitristrips

old style (RootCollisionNode named mesh) morrowind collision export

Version 2.1.11 (Oct 3, 2007)
* Export: complain on unweighted vertices and select them, instead of adding an
extra bone (this is a better alternative to the Scene Root.00 "feature" which
was pretty frustrating at times when you had to hunt down unweighted vertices)
* Export: switched to using Mesh instead of using the deprecated NMesh
* Export: fixed frame time bug
* Import: removing dummy index does not properly delete the vertex from
the mesh (yielding errors in the vertex key data), so reverted back to shift
checking algorithm to fix face index order; the vertex order is shifted in
place yielding simpler code and faster performance
* Import: removed _bindMatrix zombies, other minor cleanups
* Config: check blender version and raise exception if blender is outdated

Version 2.1.10 (Sep 27, 2007)
* Export: fairly large restructuring of the code, the Python modules are only
loaded once
* Export: fixed alpha controller export
* Export: removed disfunctional material color controller export
* Export: added a timer
* Export: new option to merge seams between objects, if you separated meshes
in different parts then on export often seams could appear between the parts
(the better bodies meshes are good examples of this problem), now there is an
option to recalculate the normals on seams between objects on export (for
better bodies the result is a seamless body on re-export)

Version 2.1.9 (Sep 21, 2007)
* Export: new option to force dds extension of texture paths

* Import: fix for import of nifs with trishape/tristrip root
* Export: simplified heuristic for naming blocks

bounds shape

Version 2.1.6 (Sep 5, 2007)
* Import: morrowind - better skeleton only import for better bodies
* Import: morrowind - better import for better bodies
* Export: make 'Bip01' root node also root of nif tree

Version 2.1.5 (Sep 2, 2007)
* Export: mopps for packed shapes
* Export: always strip texture paths (except for Morrowind and Oblivion)
* Import: shared texture folder detection for CivIV

* Installer: also check in HKCU for registry keys of Python and PyFFI (fixes
rare installation issue, see bug #1775859 on the SF tracker)
* new script for reducing number of influences per vertex, running this script
before export helps if the skin partitioning algorithm complains about losing
weights

Version 2.1.2 (Aug 17, 2007)
* Installer: make sure user is admin ("fixes" the Vista bug)
* Import: parent selected objects to armature when importing skeleton only
* Import/Export: Python profiler support (read Defaults.py for details)

* Installer: open download page if dependency not found
* Export: make 'Scene Root' node scene root
* Export: quite a few bug fixes in Oblivion collision export, saner settings
* Export: option to toggle the use of bhkListShape
* Import: fix for skeleton.nif files
* Import: reverted to 2.0.5 bone import system if bone alignment is turned off, looks much better for Oblivion imports

Version 2.1 (Aug 12, 2007)
* Export: added support for Oblivion collisions
  - bhkBoxShape (from Blender 'Box' bounding shape)
  - bhkSphereShape (from Blender 'Sphere' bounding shape)
  - bhkCapsuleShape (from Blender 'Cylinder' bounding shape)
  - bhkPackedNiTriStripsShape (from Blender 'Static TriangleMesh' bounding shape)
  - bhkConvexVerticesShape (from Blender 'Convex Hull Polytope' bounding shape)
  Note that many of the settings are not well understood, so you probably still
  have to tweak the collision settings in nifskope. But at least the collision
  geometries should be properly exported.
