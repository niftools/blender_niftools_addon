[b]Installation[/b]

This version of the scripts should keep working with newer versions of [url=http://www.blender.org]Blender 2.4x[/url] and [url=http://www.python.org]Python 2.6.x[/url] (but [i]not[/i] Python 3.x.x). At the moment of writing this, the following were used during development of the scripts:

[list][*]Be sure first to log in as administrator!
[*]Download and install [url=http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.49b/blender-2.49b-windows.exe]Blender 2.49b (32 bit)[/url], use default settings, except select "Use Blender's installation directory" when asked where to install Blender's user data.
[*]Download and install [url=http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/python-2.6.6.msi]Python 2.6.6 (32 bit)[/url], use default settings.
[*]Download and install [url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyffi/files/pyffi/2.1.8/]PyFFI 2.1.8[/url], use default settings.
[*]Download and install the [url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/niftools/files/blender_nif_scripts/2.5.x/2.5.07/]Blender NIF Scripts 2.5.7[/url], use default settings.[/list]

[b]Notes[/b]

On Windows, use 32-bit versions of Blender and Python. (The 64-bit version of Python lacks xml parsing which is essential for the scripts to work.)
